## What is the dataset about?

Every year around the world but mainly in USA and Canada, is a poll that ask people if they **Join**, **Despair** or **Meh**, some general candies; the grade of conecction that they have with specifics famous person; some question about cultural and publicity things, and some personal questions.  

For this exercise we used only the information about the candies. The main objective of the project was clean the data and found some useful information from the data.    

If you want more information about the data set, it is avaible [here](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/) 

## Tools used in this project  

  - **Language**: R  
  - **Libraries**: 
    - tidyverse    
    - janitor  
    - readxl  
    - here  
    - readr  
    - styler  
    
## Data before the cleaning process  

The raw data were in three different excel files, one for each year (2015, 2016 and 2017), with the answers of the poll for the corresponding year. The year with most records is 2015 with 5630 records.  

The problem with the data from 2015 is that year the only options for describing the candies were Join and Despair. Also they didn't ask for the gender and the country from which people answered the survey.  

## Data clean proccess  

* Clean the age column: in the survey the people were allowed from entering letters  
* Clean the country column (2016 -2017): for this were very helpfull the states and city columns  
* Select the columns for the analysis: how we said above we only needed the columns referring to gender, country, age, trick or treating yourself, and candies preferences   
* Pivot longer: candies and the preferences. This helped to do the analysis in R, because R works better with vectors 
* Add a year column in each data set, so we could identify them  when we merged all the data frames  
* Add gender and country columns in the 2015 data set. Those columns we fill with "Not ask", with the purpose of making possible the union of data sets and work with them together  
* Unit the 3 data sets  
* Filter some information without relation to a real candies, for instances "Cash, or other forms of legal tender" or "Hugs (actual physical hugs)"  


## Interesting conclusions after analyzing the data  

```{r include=FALSE}
halloween_candies <- read_csv(here("clean_data/halloween_candy.csv"))
```
* The total number of different candies were part of the survey during the three years were   `r halloween_candies %>%
    group_by(candies_food) %>%
    summarise(n_candies = n_distinct(candies_food)) %>%
    summarise(total_candies_analysis = sum(n_candies))`  
    
* The average age of people who are or aren't going out to trick or treating themsel are: 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
trick <- halloween_candies %>%
  select(trick_themself, age) %>%
  filter(!is.na(trick_themself)) %>%
  group_by(trick_themself) %>%
  summarise(average_age = round(mean(age),0))

knitr::kable(trick)
```

* The candies revived the most of joy, despair and meh, during the three years and regardless of the answer "Any full-sized candy bar", because actually is the answer with most revived in the category of Joy, are:  

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
candies <- halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_candies)) %>%
  group_by(candies_food, preference_candies) %>%
  summarise(total_votes = n()) %>%
  group_by(preference_candies) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  top_n(1)

knitr::kable(candies)

```

</center>

* The number of people rated Starburst as Despair `r halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_candies)) %>%
  filter(candies_food == "Starburst") %>%
  group_by(preference_candies) %>%
  summarise(total_starburst = n()) %>%
  filter(preference_candies == "DESPAIR") %>%
  select(total_starburst)`  
  
```{r echo=FALSE}
halloween_candies <- halloween_candies %>%
  mutate(puntuation = recode(preference_candies, 
                             DESPAIR = -1,
                             JOY = 1,
                             MEH = 0))
```

For the rest of the analysis we assumed that when the people answered despair was -1 for the candy, joy was +1 and meh was 0.  

*  The most popular candy by this rating system for each gender in the dataset, during the three years and regardless of the answer "Any full-sized candy bar", because actually is the answer with the best rating for women and men, are:  


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gender <- halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!c(gender == "Not ask" | is.na(preference_candies))) %>%
  group_by(gender, candies_food) %>%
  summarise(total_prefence = sum(puntuation)) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  top_n(1)

knitr::kable(gender)
```


* The most popular candy by this rating system for each year in the dataset, regardless of the answer "Any full-sized candy bar", because actually is the answer with the best rating each year, are:  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
year <- halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_candies)) %>%
  group_by(year, candies_food) %>%
  summarise(total_prefence = sum(puntuation)) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_prefence)) %>%
  top_n(1)

knitr::kable(year)

```


* The most popular candy by this rating system for USA, Canada, UK and the other countries in the dataset, regardless of the answer "Any full-sized candy bar", because is the answer  with the best rating in USA, Canada and the other countries, are:  

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

country <- halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!c(year == 2015 | is.na(preference_candies))) %>%
  mutate(country = ifelse(country %in% c("USA", "Canada", "UK"), country, "Other"))%>%
  group_by(country, candies_food)  %>%
  summarise(total_prefence = sum(puntuation)) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_prefence)) %>%
  top_n(1) 

knitr::kable(country)

```
