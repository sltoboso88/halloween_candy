* Select the columns for the analysis  
* Pivot longer (candies and the preferences)  
* Add a year column in each data set.  
* Add some columns that 2015 data set didn't have. 
* Unit the 3 data sets and filter some information without relation to a real candy

  group_by(trick_themself) %>%
  summarise(average_age = round(mean(age),0))
```

3. Candy bar revived the most of joy, despair and meh  

```{r}
halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_candies)) %>%
  group_by(candies_food, preference_candies) %>%
  summarise(total_votes = n()) %>%
  group_by(preference_candies) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  top_n(1)
```

4. People rated Starburst as despair  

```{r}
halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_candies)) %>%
  filter(candies_food == "Starburst") %>%
  group_by(preference_candies) %>%
  summarise(total_starburst = n()) %>%
  filter(preference_candies == "DESPAIR")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
halloween_candies <- halloween_candies %>%
  mutate(puntuation = recode(preference_candies, 
                             DESPAIR = -1,
                             JOY = 1,

```

5. Most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset  

```{r}
halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!c(gender == "Not ask" | is.na(preference_candies))) %>%
  group_by(gender, candies_food) %>%
  summarise(total_prefence = sum(puntuation)) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  top_n(1)
```

It is Any full-sized candy bar, in each year.

  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_prefence)) %>%
  top_n(1)
```

7. Most popular candy bar by this rating system for each country in the dataset 
```{r}
halloween_candies %>%
  filter(!c(year == 2015 | is.na(preference_candies))) %>%
  mutate(country = ifelse(country %in% c("USA", "Canada", "UK"), country, "Other"))%>%
  group_by(country, candies_food)  %>%
  summarise(total_prefence = sum(puntuation)) %>%
  filter(candies_food != "Any full-sized candy bar") %>%
